# BINARY SEARCH
# This search is performed in a "sorted" list. Searching of key begins from the middle index.
# Element is searched in the left sublist if element at the middle index is greater than the key.
# Element is searched in the right sublist if element at the middle index is lower than the key.
# This is a recursive process.
# Finally, function returns index of element if key is present. Returns '-1' if key is absent.


# Time Complexity
# Average Case: O(logn)
# Best Case: O(1) -> When key is present at the middle index.
